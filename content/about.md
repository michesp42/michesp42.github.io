Hi I'm Michael, thank you for stopping by.

I'm a Linux hobbyist and learner of technologies and tools surrounding Linux.
I'm also learning some programming, markup/typesetting languages; basically,
anything that is fun.

In this website I write about Linux, programming, some math and books, and any
other interesting stuff I may deem worth writing about. Another purpose of this
website is for me to document the projects that I sorely need to make.
